# Simple Particle Animation
# 🕹️ IMPORTANT
This repository contains a simple implementation of a simulation that simuates the motion of charged particles under the influence of Coulomb force using Python. TThe simulation includes particles like protons and electrons, and visualizes their movements and the resulting electric fields in a 2D plane. 

The aim of this project was to learn basics of particle simulation and more in general, object and physics simulation as a stepping stone for a bigger project.
